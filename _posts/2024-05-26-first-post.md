# Introduction
Hello everyone, I would like to talk about an important case that should be considered while developing an application in Flutter. Sometimes in your app’s flow, you may want the user to complete a task on the current page. Although you do not offer a back option in the application, Android devices have a physical back button. If you ignore this, it may disrupt your entire flow and even cause your application to crash. In Flutter, the WillPopScope widget is used to handle this situation. This widget detects the user’s attempt to press the back button and provides the ability to handle this event in a customizable way.

### What is WillPopScope?

WillPopScope is a Flutter widget that allows you to intercept the back button press event or the system-level navigation attempt and handle it according to your app's requirements. It wraps its child widget and provides a callback that gets triggered when the user tries to navigate back.

### Usage of WillPopScope
1.  Wrap your desired widget with  `WillPopScope`.
2.  Provide an  `onWillPop`  callback function that defines the actions to be taken when the user presses the back button.
3.  Inside the  `onWillPop`  function, implement the logic that suits your app's needs.
4.  Return a `Future<bool>` from the `onWillPop` function. Return `true` to allow the back navigation or `false` to prevent it.

```dart
WillPopScope(  
  onWillPop: () async {  
    // Custom logic codes  
    // Return true to allow back navigation, false to prevent it  
  },  
  child: YourView(),  
),
```
